      <p className="font-bold text-2xl tracking-tight px-40 mb-10">
        Before learning to code, I graduated from the University of Oxford with a degree in Biomedical Sciences. I transitioned into tech by undertaking an intensive software development bootcamp, where I gained hands-on experience with software development. My scientific training taught me to approach problems methodically, while my development experience sharpened my skills in JavaScript, React, Node.js, and SQL, and in working effectively within collaborative, high-performing teams.

      <p className="font-bold text-2xl tracking-tight px-40 mb-10">
        Iâ€™m eager to apply my unique background to create impactful, user-focused technology and to keep learning, growing, and contributing to projects that make a real difference.
